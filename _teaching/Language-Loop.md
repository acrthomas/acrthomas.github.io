As an instructor at Language Loop---located in Chicago's West Loop---I provided both private and small group lessons to adult learners of English. A training workshop was undergone prior to any classes being held and the curriculum was open and left entirely up to my discretion. Students usually took at minimum 10 hours of instruction, in 2 hour blocks, at a frequency that best fit their schedule.
