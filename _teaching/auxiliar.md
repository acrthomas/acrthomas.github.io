After obtaining my B.A. in Spanish Studies, I participated in the North American Language and Culture Assistants Program (aka Auxiliares de Conversación extranjeros en España), which places American and Canadian English L1 speakers as teaching assistants in elementary and secondary schools throughout Spain. For the 2015 - 2016 academic year, I worked at both CEIP Fausto Maldonado in Cañamero and at CEIP Nuestra Señora del Consuelo in Logrosán, two of the smaller municipalities located within the province of Cáceres, in the Autonomous Community of Extremadura. I was present in English, Literature, Art, and Science classes for students ages 6 through 12.
