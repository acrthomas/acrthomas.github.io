As part of my graduate assistantship at SIUC, I taught English Composition I and II for English Students, the Linguistics Department's equivalent of English 101 and 102 for international and English L2 students. Although I wasn't the instructor of record, I was the primary instructor and sole presence in the classroom. I taught LING 101 once in Fall 2018 and LING 102 twice in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. Both curricula covered a) personal narratives/descriptive essays, b) comparison essays, c) cause & effect essays, and d) argumentative essays, in order to help students become more comfortable with and proficient in writing for academic audiences. Over the span of the two courses, students learned to find and incorporate secondary sources, and developed strategies for planning, drafting, revising, and editing papers.
