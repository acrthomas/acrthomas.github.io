LinguisTeX is a quick & dirty introduction to LaTeX for linguistics that I wrote and shared as part of the Summer Workshop Series during my first year at Northwestern.

This workshop makes use of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), an online LaTeX editor, for the sake of convenience (no need to download anything). You can view and compile the document [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ywjrygdxkbpr); it makes ample use of comments, so be sure to look at the source code!
