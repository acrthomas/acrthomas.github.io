Hello and welcome to my little corner of the web!

I'm currently a third year PhD student in Northwestern University's Linguistics Department as a part of the [Prosody and Speech Dynamics (ProSD) Lab](https://www.prosodylab.linguistics.northwestern.edu/).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in linguistic interfaces. My recent research sits at the juncture of sociolinguistics and prosody; my [MA thesis](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2437344538?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true) was on the prosodic systems of Standard Basque speakers, and my qualifying paper assesses macro-rhythm as a potential method for distinguishing dialects, looking particularly at African American English (AAE) and Mainstream US English (MUSE).
